The 2048 game is a single-player puzzle game where the objective is to combine tiles on a grid to reach the 2048 tile. Hereâ€™s a basic overview of how it works:

Grid: The game is played on a 4x4 grid.

Tiles: Each tile has a number (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) and starts with a value of either 2 or 4. The numbers on tiles increase as you combine them.

Gameplay:

Move Tiles: You can move the tiles up, down, left, or right. Tiles with the same number that collide during a move will combine into one tile with their sum.
New Tiles: After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears in an empty space on the grid.
Objective: The goal is to combine tiles to reach the 2048 tile. However, the game continues beyond that, and achieving higher numbers is possible.

Game Over: The game ends when no more moves are possible, meaning the grid is full and no adjacent tiles have the same number to combine.

Strategy: Effective strategies involve planning moves to keep high-value tiles together and maintaining a manageable grid.

The game is known for its simple mechanics but challenging strategy, making it addictive and engaging.
